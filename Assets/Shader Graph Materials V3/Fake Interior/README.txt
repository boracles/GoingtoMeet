Fake Interior Shader

The Fake Interior shader is designed to simulate an interior space within an object by utilizing a cubemap and various parameters to control rotation, tiling, and depth. 
This shader is useful for creating the illusion of depth in windows, glass surfaces, or enclosed structures without rendering actual interior geometry.
Inside the graph is a gradient that you can change to have different tint for each tile.

Properties
Cubemap Interior: Defines the cubemap texture representing the interior environment (which can be generated by backing a reflection probe).
Rotation Degree: Controls the rotation of the cubemap to align the interior perspective with the viewer’s angle.
Tiling: Adjusts the repetition of the interior texture to scale the effect appropriately.
Depth: Defines the depth of the interior effect, influencing how far inside the space appears.
Albedo Texture: The primary color texture applied to the surface of the object, the alpha is used as the windows.
Normal Map: Provides surface detail for better light interaction and realism.

Usage
This shader is particularly useful for creating the illusion of depth in static objects where rendering a full interior is unnecessary. 
By carefully adjusting the rotation, tiling, and depth properties, users can achieve a realistic fake interior effect in their materials.
