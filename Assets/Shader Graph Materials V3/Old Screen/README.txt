Old Screen Shader

The Old Screen Shader simulates the appearance of an old LED screen by adjusting pixel tiling, LED size, brightness, and texture properties.

Properties
Albedo: Defines the base texture of the screen.
Mask Tiling (# Pixels): Sets the tiling for the pixel mask effect, which changes the number of pixels.
LED Width: Adjusts the horizontal width of individual LED pixels.
LED Height: Adjusts the vertical height of individual LED pixels.
Brightness: Controls the overall brightness of the screen effect.
Tiling n Offset: Defines the tiling and offset values for texture adjustments.

Usage
This shader is ideal for retro display effects, pixelated screen simulations, or any material needing an old LED aesthetic. 
Adjust tiling, LED size, and brightness for desired visual results.
