Twisted Shader

The Twisted Shader applies geometry manipulation, normal mapping, and emission effects while allowing control over material properties like smoothness, metallicity.

Properties
Albedo: Defines the base color texture of the material.
Color: Sets the tint color applied to the texture.
Emission: Controls the intensity of self-emission lighting.
Normal: Defines the normal map for surface detail.
Normal Strength: Adjusts the influence of the normal map.
AO: Defines the ambient occlusion texture for shadowing.
Tiling: Controls the repetition of textures.
Smoothness: Adjusts the material’s surface smoothness.
Metallic: Defines how metallic the surface appears.
Multiplier: Adjusts the amount of twist.
World Axis: Defines the axis to twist around
Offset: Adds an offset to the twist.

This shader uses the camera position to twist the mesh.
This corridor has no lights it is all baked, feel free to use it/modify if you want.

Note: if using HDRP you have to increase Emission to around a thousand then bake lights again.
