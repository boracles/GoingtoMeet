Procedural Polygons Shader

The Procedural Polygons Shader generates dynamic polygonal shapes with adjustable tiling, shape complexity, size, and rotation speed.

Properties
Tiling: Controls the repetition of the polygon pattern.
Shape Sides Min: Sets the minimum number of sides for generated shapes.
Shape Sides Max: Sets the maximum number of sides for generated shapes.
Width n Height: Defines the width and height random scaling factors.
Color Lightness: Adjusts the brightness of the polygon colors.
Max Rotation Speed: Controls the maximum speed at which polygons rotate.

Usage
This shader is useful for procedural pattern generation, abstract visuals, and animated polygon-based effects. 
Adjust the tiling, shape complexity, and rotation speed to achieve different styles.
