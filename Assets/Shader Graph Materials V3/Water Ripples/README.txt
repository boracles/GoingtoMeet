Water Ripples Shader

The Water Ripples Shader simulates dynamic water ripple effects with adjustable strength, speed, depth, and color properties.

Properties
Strength: Controls the intensity of the ripple effect.
Speed: Adjusts the rate at which ripples move.
Tiling: Defines the scale and repetition of the ripples.
Depth: Determines the range of effect to blend based on depth.
Water Color Offset: Modifies where the blend starts based on depth.
Color: Sets the base color of the water.

Usage
This shader is useful for creating animated water surfaces, ripple effects, and stylized fluid simulations. 
Adjust strength, speed, and tiling for desired visual results.

Note: if you are using HDRP make sure that the rendering pass of the material is "default" and use a very small value for Transparency Brightness like 0.00005 or so
